# üìù Assumptions & Design Choices

### Options are stored with unique IDs so answers can map directly.

### The answer provided during question creation must match one of the options.

### Submissions compare the submitted answer ID (aid) with the stored correct answer‚Äôs ID.

### APIs are RESTful and kept simple for easy frontend integration.

### MongoDB instance is assumed to be running locally or via Docker.
